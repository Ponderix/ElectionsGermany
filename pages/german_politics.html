                    Politics in Germany may seem complicated for some— especially those who are used to a two-party system, and simple for others. Germany is a democratic, federal Republic, with two main legislative bodies. The Bundestag, which is directly elected by the people and is the primary parliamentary body; and the Bundesrat which only has say in a few issues and is not elected by the people.

                    To elect the Bundestag, Germany uses an electoral system where recieve seats proportionally to how many votes they get. This leads to a multi-party parliament where, since 1957, no single party (or electoral alliance) has controlled more than 50% of seats. As a consequence, governments require multiple participating parties to form.
                    <br></br>
                    Due to the fact that Germany is a federal nation, it has sixteen very powerful states ("Bundesländer" in German). In similar fashion to the fifty US states, each has its own state legislature which is elected every 5 years.

                <h5>Political Parties and Alliances</h5>
                <p>
                    For most of the post-war years, only three to four political parties were represented in the Bundestag. Similar to most Western democracies, there was a large, generally liberal and leftist party; a large conservative party and a minor centrist and market orientated party. Sometimes there was also an ecologist Green party, however they were treated as fringe and even extremist in some cases. Then after German reunification the number of parties grew significantly, whilst the share of votes for the tradtional parties decreased as party loyalty became less of a defining factor in Politics. Currently the largest party represented in the Bundestag, the SPD, recieved only 25.7% of the vote, where only a few decades ago the largest party would consistently recieve over 40% of the vote. This shows the extent of political fragmentation in modern German politics.

                                <p>The SPD is Germany's oldest Party, it was formed in 1875 after a merge of multiple marxist and worker's-interest parties. It has existed through three very different German states, at first the German Reich, then the Weimar Republic and consequently the Third Reich as well as the current Republic of Germany. Ever since the late 19th century it was the dominant liberal political force in German politics.</p>
                                <p>The Party itself stands for an expanded welfare system, a reduction of social and economic inequalities as well as a pro-european outlook. The SPD has participated in multiple governments acorss the past two centuries, along with parties such as the Greens, the FDP and the CDU.</p>
                                <p>Voter's of the SPD are mainly found under the elderly population (60+). SPD voters are also generally Protestant or non religious, they are either working class or pensioners and generally are not very wealthy. Most of its support is concentrated in the Ruhr area, the former industrial heartland of Germany; the city states such as Hamburg and Bremen; the industrial areas around Hannover and Wolfsburg, and in the northern parts of former East-Germany.</p>

The CDU runs in all of Germany except Bavaria and the CSU only runs in Bavaria. In the Bundestag they act as one party.

                                    <p>The CDU was the dominant party in German politics for most of the post-war era Germany. It has lead 19/26 of the post-war governments, and up until late 2021 there were many people, including myself, who had grown up knowing no other governing party except the CDU and Chancellor Merkel. The CDU is seen by many a party which stands for stability and pragmatic politics, neither to much to the right or too much to the left.</p>
                                    <p>Even though the name implies a heavy emphasis on Christianity, the CDU does not advocate radical religious doctrine and does not seek to enforce a certain religion upon the people. In fact, it was created as a party which would bridge divides between Protestantism and Catholicism, which up until the second world war were very much opposed to each other politically. The CDU is a generally conservative party which supports a small welfare state and believes in powers of free market capitalism. However, under Merkel the party has become more moderate and has adopted more liberal social policies.</p>
                                    <p>Like the SPD, CDU recieves most of its support from the elderly population. It is also supported by religious Christians and those who generally earn more. This support is concentrated around Nord Rhine-Westpfalen, which is one of the more Catholic states, and around the border with the Netherlands. A significant portion of its support is also concentrated in the south of Germany, which is generally wealthier.</p>
