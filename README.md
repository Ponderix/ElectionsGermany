Hello,
As I am unable to launch this on a server due to security issues with the code, this README.md will give you instructions as to how to open this website.

1. Download the entire content of the MAIN branch by pressing the green button in the top right named "Code[down arrow]"
2. You should have three files in a folder, one named main.html, one style.css and one script.js
3. To launch the website open the main.html file in a browser by double-clicking it or dragging it into a browser window
